  "body": "# Welcome!\r\nSo this is a page I created ~~not entirely voluntary~~ for a course I'm taking at the University of Amsterdam.  I have made a [simple website](www.sterrenwachtcopernicus.nl) before but **I'm new at making a GitHub Page**. Is seems easy enough though. In the weeks to come, I will regulary change and update this page. If you are interested _tag along_ (pun intended).\r\n\r\n## About the course\r\n>[_Information Analytics_](http://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2016-2017/zoek-vak/vak/25673) treats the new ways to derive meaning from information or (big) data. Information has become more diverse and fluid, and significance is often taken for granted in analysis or use of data. However, the analysis, use and re-use also creates new data, with diverse and often incommensurable meanings. This course explores the contexts of use, practical methods and theoretical implications of contemporary information analytics.\r\n\r\n###### _Want to know what we were and will be up to? Check out [the course's repository](https://github.com/MA-Archival-Information-Studies/MA-Archival-and-Information-Studies)_. If not, [have a look here](https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder982/500x/30644982.jpg).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Curated Content & Representation\r\nIn the second class we (my fellow students and I) will learn and talk about 'Curated Content and Representation'. \r\n###### _**Interesting huh**_? Yesssss! Or at least, I think so. Not so much? You might want to consider looking at another page. Or, [click here](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/f2/f29cd255b59bda6107a1633f382749d0fe7bc652df2fc8eefc8ee24f4301f90e.jpg).\r\nBefore class, we have to do a few things:\r\n 1. Start a GitHub Page \r\n 2. Read (not weep): \r\n   * [Ontology is overrated](MA-Archival-and-Information-Studies/Information-Analytics-&-Digital-Humanities/Content-Curation/Shirky_ Ontology is Overrated.pdf) (Clay Shirky, 2009) \r\n   * [Digital Curation for Digital natives](MA-Archival-and-Information-Studies/Information-Analytics-&-Digital-Humanities/Content-Curation/Yakel_Digital curation for digital natives_2011.pdf) (Liz Yakel et al, 2011) \r\n 3. Have a look at [the resources and guidance offered by the Collection Trust (UK)](http://www.collectionstrust.org.uk/collections-link)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
